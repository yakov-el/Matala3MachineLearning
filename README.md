For your prediction, you should train the following models: • Linear regression • Polynomial regression • Ridge regression • Lasso regression • Random Forest • KNeighborsRegressor Tune the model’s hyperparameters to come up with the best prediction. For the polynomial  regression, compare different degrees; for the ridge and lasso, choose the best value for α;  for the forest, experiment with the number of trees and depth; for the K-nn… you should  choose the best K. Note that you must use cross-validation. You are given a free hand on finding the best  parameters for each model (i.e., manually or using hyperparameter tuning methods as  learned in class). While each row has a definite date, you are not expected to model this data as a time series (i.e., account for the past n days when predicting the number of positive tests tomorrow). If  you want, you can use this information to generate new features.
